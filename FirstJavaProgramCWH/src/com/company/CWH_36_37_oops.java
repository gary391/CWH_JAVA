        Class (Contains info to create a valid object) ---> Object Instantiation ---> Object

        Object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template is defined. Memory is allocated only
        after object instantiation.

        Example: Object represent an actual employee who will have some attributes, where each employee is different.

        Q: How to model a problem in OOPS?

        Nonu --> Class --> Employee
        Adjective --> Attributes  --> Name, Age, Salary,
        Verb --> Methods --> getSalary(), increment()


        Abstraction: Hiding Internal Details [SHow only essential info!!]

        IPhone - use this phone without bothering about how it was made.
        Android app development


        Encapsulation: The act of putting various components together (in a capsule)
        Medical Capsule

        Laptop - Laptop is a single entity with wifi + speaker + storage in a single box!
        Car - Engine + chair + stereo

        - Sensitive data can be hidden from the users!

        Inheritance - The act of deriving new things from existing things

        Rickshaw --> E-Rickshaw (Battery Powered + Motor + Rickshaw)
        Phone --> Smart Phone

        Polymorphism - One entity many forms

        SmartPhone -> Phone, SmartPhone -> Calculate, SmartPhone -> Camera -> SmartPhone -> AlarmClock
