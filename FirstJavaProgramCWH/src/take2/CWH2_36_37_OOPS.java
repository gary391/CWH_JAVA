/*
DRY - Don't repeat yourself
OBJECT - An object is an instance of a class
When a class is defined a template is created. Memory is allocated only after object is instantiated.

NOUN ---> CLASS ---> EMPLOYEE
ADJECTIVE ---> ATTRIBUTES ---> NAME, AGE, SALARY
VERB ---> METHODS ---> getSalary(), increment()

Abstraction - Hide internal details [Don't bother to find out how it is working?]
Encapsulation - Act of putting various components together (in a capsule) Example - Laptop
Inheritance - The act of deriving new things from the old or existing things --> Smart phones from phones
Polymorphism - One entity many forms. Smartphone is phone, Smartphone is a camera as well.
